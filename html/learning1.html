						<span>ReactJs</span>
						<p>	
							React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
						</p>
						<p>
							Starting with the basics of JSX syntax, this course will teach you how to model UI components using React Components. By the end you should be able to manage the state and life cycle of React Components and use them to dynamically generate lists and forms.
						</p>

						<p>
							A react application is made of multiple components, each responsible for rendering a small, reusable piece of HTML. Components can be nested within other components to allow complex applications to be built out of simple building blocks. A component may also maintain internal state – for example a TabList component may store a variable corresponding to the currently open tab.
						</p>
						<span>NOTE:</span><p>React is not a framework. It is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that they were facing.
						</p>
						<p><span>Initial release:</span> March 29, 2013</p>
						<span>How does it works:</span>
						<p>
							While building client-side apps, a team at Facebook developers realized that the DOM is slow (The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.). So, to make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in Javascript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browser’s DOM.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements. The rationale for this is that JavaScript is very fast and it’s worth keeping a DOM tree in it to speedup its manipulation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although React was conceived to be used in the browser, because of its design it can also be used in the server with Node.js.
						</p>
						<span>What's the purpose of using React.js?</span>
						<p>ReactJS is an open-source library created and maintained by facebook. Right now it has more than 60.000 stars on Github and the surrounding community is getting bigger and bigger. Many well-established companies or fast developing startups have decided to use it in order to provide responsive and modern user interfaces by taking advantage of its powerful features.
						</p>
						<span>React Features</span>
						<h3>JSX</h3><p>JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX   in React development, but it is recommended.
						</p>
						<h3>Components</h3><p> - React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.</p>
						<h3>License </h3><p> React is licensed under the Facebook Inc. Documentation is licensed under CC BY 4.0.
						</p>
						<span>React Advantages</span>
						<ul>
							<li>Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.</li>
							<li>Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks</li>
							<li>Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.</li>
						</ul>
						<span> React Limitations</span>
						<ul>
							<li>Covers only the view layer of the app, hence you still need to choose other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development.</li>
							<li>Uses inline templating and JSX, which might seem awkward to some developers.</li>
						</ul>
						<span>Why should we use it?</span>
						<p>ReactJS basically is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications. It's used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.  The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.</p>
